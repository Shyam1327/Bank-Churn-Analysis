# Bank Customer Churn Analysis 
### 📁 Project Overview
- Customer churn is a major challenge for banks, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 bank customers to identify the key factors influencing churn and to provide data-driven insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.
- Using Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI for interactive dashboards, this project uncovers patterns related to demographics, customer activity, and product usage.
### 🎯 Objectives
- Understand characteristics of customers who are more likely to churn.
- Identify the most important drivers of churn.
- Build clear and interactive visuals to help business stakeholders interpret the results.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and boost retention.

### 🔎 Key Insights
- Churn is more strongly impacted by engagement and demographics than by income or account balance.
- Inactive members, single-product customers, and customers based in Germany show the highest churn rates.
- Younger customers demonstrate slightly higher churn probability.
- Customers with two products tend to stay longer than those with only one.

### 🧠 Recommendations
- Focus retention efforts on inactive customers through targeted engagement campaigns.
- Encourage single-product customers to adopt additional banking products.
- Investigate regional churn factors, especially in Germany.
- Develop personalized retention strategies for younger customers.

### 📝 Conclusion
- The findings indicate that churn is largely affected by how engaged customers are and by their demographic characteristics, rather than their earnings or account balances. Targeting key groups—such as inactive users, customers with only one product, and those located in Germany—can help the bank significantly boost its retention rates.
